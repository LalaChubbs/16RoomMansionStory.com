    So I'm 16 and nate is 16 we used to be with our parents about a year back and how it happened is because we stumbled apon a shady

    <p>character when we finished character when we finished our 
     school that day and the shady character said " hello there would you like to buy this house its a good price and its a no brainer to get this it only cost 1000 dollars "  I said "so whats the catch ?" The shady character said " there is no catch "
     My friend whispered " why don't we get it  i whispered "Are you mad how can we afford that he whispered "why don't we earn 5 dollars a day we add it up and we have 10 dollars a day so in a 100 days we can
      afford that " I whispered "actually thats possible but it depends when

     <p>the deal ends and I'll try and do 
      some research for the best money 
      ways on joogle for maybe some
      space to expand our house into a mansion " he whispered " yay that will be sick " i asked "how long will this deal last " the shady person said about 145 days cause I need the money quick so I can afford a vehicle " I said "oh ok so that will be fine with us won't it nate " nudge he replied with" yeah that will be fine"
     So we went home and the same day I started researching how to make  1000 dollars a day and 1 result came and it said how to make 1000 dollars and the link took me to a

            <p>website called goutube and I 
                watched the whole 10 minutes and 
                6 seconds through then I tried it and it worked so I couldn't wait to tell my 
                friend we can buy the house .the very next day... I told him I have enough for the house and he was shocked so we bought the house and we straight away we told our parents then we moved in so we couldn't wait we bought a lot of things like a hot tub cooling tub and other stuff so that is our story of how we got this house after I told you that I heard mysterious sounds coming from the freezing room so I carefully approached the room and

                <p>you'll never gues what I found a little 
                    kitten but it was frozen so I quickly 
                    took the kitten to the boiling room and waited for the ice to melt and then I showed nate and he said "can we keep it" I said "if you want to " he said "heck yeah " I said "so what shall we name it " he said "maybe James " I said "ok then that will be a good name but first we need to give him a clean" he said "why don't we give him a clean in the hot tub i said "ok but we need to put it on a warm temperature instead of hot temperatures " i said "yeah we should treat the kitten " he said " yeah we should " walking he said

                    <p>  "ok let's put the kitten in and come 
                        back in 5 minutes so then we 
                        started writing on our book but we only got one page done so we went to check one him and he was soaking so we took him out and put him in the drying room because we can't be bothered drying with a towel which is all the way to the 2nd floor so we quickly left it in the drying room for 5 minutes while we do some more writing but we only got one page done so we checked on James and he was half dried so we went back to writing and we got another page done and then we came back to check on him and he 
                        Page 6</p>
                        <p>was done so we went on a walk to 
                            the park and we saw a creepy person we tried hiding but we knew It was no good running he was too fast but we outran him then we ran into our house and we quickly went hid next to the freezing room and we closed the freezing room door and we waited for him to come and look inside so we could lock him in and take him back to the desert and drive away so the plan worked and we trapped him and took him when he froze and he'll unfreeze in the desert by the time were at home so we did that but we didn't bring James we left him at home and by

                            <p> the time were back we 
                                couldn't find him then we found a note saying I took your kitten but the only way you can get him back is if you bring my friend with you the address is ###### make sure to come with my friend . We were shocked so we had a image of the person so we 3d printed him and we froze the 3d print to make it look realistic so we brought the fake person to the place and we traded but we quickly went back with the kitten and now we have to add security to the house so we hired 2 body guards to protect the house and now were going to always keep

                            <p> him with us but then we straight 
                                away heard a knock and we knew who it was but it actually wasn't who we thought it was it was the person we left in the desert he said "why did you leave me in the desert I just wanted to be friends" i said "oh I thought you were trying to kill us " he said " why would I do that " I said cause you look like someone who would and you started chasing us so we thought you'll kill us he said "no i won't i just want a job " I said "oh ok so what type of job do you want " he said "I want a shop type " I said "oh ok maybe you could sell tickets for people to swim in our

                                    that job " I said "ok you can start now if you want " he said "ok sure" I was so happy we can make more money and we have a new friend then I told him "that your friend is angry we took you so can you apologise to him and tell him that you work with us " he said  "ok ill do it but do you wanna come with me to his house okay but which friend  "I said " the one who's address is ###### and yes we can come cant we nate " nudge he said "yeah we can come  "  he said "ok let's go" and we apologised and  he said is working for us cause he wants to

                                    <p>work for us cause he asked for a job
                                        and we all went outside for another walk and we went to a shop called eatyou and we went in and it was quite weird in there because there was no one in except 1 person who owned the shop and he was acting weird so we thought about going so we did and the guy said where are you going I said" your a bit weird" then I realised why did I say that and then he said "your not going and then he locked the doors with a remote so we all quickly scattered around so he couldn't catch us all but he catched us and he tried boiling us and we were higher than

                                            connected to a rope and there were 
                                            these fruit monster people so I cut the rope cause with my phone case cause the rope ripped when I rubbed them together then I let him free and got some of the fruit monsters locked on the rope then we escaped through a vent but we ended up in a castle then we found a sword each and then we went back to the eatyou shop and sliced them all in half then we went to a food shop like a chicken takeaway and we all got deep fried medium sized chicken and then we ate the food when we arrived home and the
